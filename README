# TFLMKeyboard

Currently supports a morpheme-aware character language model. Sample Guarani model (```converted_model.tflite```) lives in the assets directory, along with the set of symbols the LM is aware of (```labels.txt```), in order of their numerical index as used by the neural net.

Currently, the keyboard uses a simplified prediction logic. It presents continuations of the current input, up to the next predicted boundary (morpheme, word, or sentence). In the keyboard view, word continuations are presented with a ```"_"``` at the end, morpheme continuations with a ```"@"```, and sentences with a ```"<eos>"```.

This is achieved via a greedy unroll of the top 3 character predictions given the character history (i.e., running the language model with it's top choice given some starting point).

Note that when you load the keyboard from Android studio, you may need to activate it as an input method:

```Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboard -> Manage Keyboard```

TODO: Add additional logic for rewriting the current unit, rather than just completing it.

## Building on the command line:

```
$ gradle assembleDebug
```

The `.apk` will be found in `./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.


## Key classes and methods:

```LanguageModel/LanguageModelMobileNet```: These classes in the ```tflite``` directory store the code for loading a Tensorflow Lite model, and using it to generate keyboard predictions. See ```LanguageModel::generate()``` for the inference function.

```SmartKeyboard```: This kotlin class in the ```service``` directory contains all the relevant keyboard code. Here are the some important functions:

```SmartKeyboard::updateCandidates() //Get a new set of predicted continuations based on the current input history.```

```SmartKeyboard::getPredictions() //Call the language model to get some number of prediction candidates.```

```SmartKeyboard::pickSuggestion() //What should the keyboard do when the user picks a predicted continuation?```

```SmartKeyboard::handleBackspace() //What should happen if the user made a mistake and backs up?```
